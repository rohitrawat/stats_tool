NuClass can be obtained form: http://www-ee.uta.edu/eeweb/ip/

Run the script "stats_tool.m" to start the GUI. (Do not open the.fig file!). 
The GUI is self explanatory. The command line version is also included.

Help:
This tool accepts processing results files generated by NuClass, and performs 
sensitivity, specificity, ROC curve, and AUC computation. Run NuClass in 
processing mode to produce the processing result files for each cross-validation
data set, and save them under different names. Click the Add files button to add
these files to the list of files. The remove and clear buttons work as 
advertised. 
ROC plot options: To display the ROC plot for each validation file, select 
"Each plot in new window". To only display the averaged plot, select the other 
option. The averaged plot will be diplayed in both the cases. To save the 
displayed plots as JPEG files in the current directory, check the box 
underneath. The JPEG files will have the same names as the processing 
results files, but with a JPEG extension. The averaged plot is saved as 
"averaged_ROC_plot.jpg". The positive class label should be set to 1 or 2, 
depending on what label has been used for the positive class. The negative class
(or the controls class) is automatically assigned the other label.
